	abstract = {The {MovieLens} datasets are widely used in education, research, and industry. They are downloaded hundreds of thousands of times each year, reflecting their use in popular press programming books, traditional and online courses, and software. These datasets are a product of member activity in the {MovieLens} movie recommendation system, an active research platform that has hosted many experiments since its launch in 1997. This article documents the history of {MovieLens} and the {MovieLens} datasets. We include a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform from the perspective of a research organization. We document best practices and limitations of using the {MovieLens} datasets in new research.},
